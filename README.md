80/20 Boilerplate for WordPress
===============================

80/20 Boilerplate for WordPress is a heavily opinionated, unstyled WordPress
theme based on Paul Irish' [HTML5 Boilerplate][1]. It does not include any CSS
styles and is intended to be used as a parent theme with a separate
[80/20 Compass extensions][2] for easy layout and style scaffolding.
