80/20 Boilerplate for WordPress
===============================

80/20 Boilerplate for WordPress is a heavily opinionated, unstyled WordPress
theme based on Paul Irish' [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/).
It does not include any CSS styles and is intended to be used as a parent theme
with a separate Compass extensions (coming soon) for easy layout and style
scaffolding.
